The method handleRequest is called in my code. The relevant argument for this method is the URL of the web server, which is https://0-0-0-0-3002-f5323givi9rl9tov606akq9cag.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello. The relevant fields are a string named line and an int named num. Num is set to 0 and increments by one whenever a new message is requested to represent a number list with each line displaying the message. In this case, num increments only once and has a value of 1 because only one message was requested. Line is an empty string variable that is concatenated with various factors: num, a ".", the message that the user inputs, and "\n." Line is constantly updated but retains previous data to display every line in the list. In this example, line is updated only once with num = 1, and the message being "Hello."

Similar to the first example, handleRequest is the only method called. In this example, however, there are two arguments for this method. The first url is the same as above, https://0-0-0-0-3002-f5323givi9rl9tov606akq9cag.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello. And the second one is https://0-0-0-0-3002-f5323givi9rl9tov606akq9cag.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello%20123. Num is set to 0 at first, and increments by 1 twice, ending with a value of 2. It is incremented each time a new message is requested. Line begins as an empty string, but is concatenated twice. The first time, num is 1 and the message inputed is "Hello." The second time, num is 2 and the message is "Hello 123." Line retains the data from the first message and just adds the second message into the variable.
